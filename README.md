# Stable Diffusion Text-to-Image Generation
This project demonstrates the use of a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, a type of latent diffusion model, for text-to-image generation. Latent diffusion models are designed to draw samples from complex, high-dimensional probability distributions, making them powerful tools for image synthesis.

In this project, I utilized Stable Diffusion as a conditional image synthesis model. By interacting with text embeddings, the model can generate high-quality images that match the textual descriptions provided.

The project is developed and executed using Google Colab to make it accessible and easy to run, allowing you to experiment with text prompts and visualize the model's output without the need for extensive local setup.
